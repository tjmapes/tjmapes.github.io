I've had the technology itch as of late.  I've been working on hiring a couple developers, so I've been trying to really get in the mindset of a developer.  I subscribed to a bunch of new podcasts centered around development.

One I listened to today really peaked my interest.  It featured an interview with [Parker Moore](https://github.com/parkr).

I don't know *anything* about markdown, ruby, jekyll... none of this stuff.  But I'm learning as I type this.

I kind of feel like I'm back pushing live edits to the FTP for some sites I ran back in the early 90's.  And ya know what, it feels damn good.  But now I have **version control**!
