<p>So, during my current quest to re-platform my <a href="http://www.riptapparel.com">online T-Shirt business</a>, I&rsquo;ve been scouring the internet researching everything under the sun.  Every platform possible, every case study possible, you name it.  More to come on that front later.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ve had small successes reaching out to those in the community of said platforms, but as I&rsquo;ve been contacting people individually, I thought to my self, why isn&rsquo;t there just a place where I can go and get advice from people with ease?  So I started two Slack Communities.</p>

<p>If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with Slack, it&rsquo;s basically a chat room.  Many people relate it to the IRC days, if you were into that sort of thing (I was).  It&rsquo;s NOT just a chat room though, it comes with some <a href="https://slack.com/integrations">special integrations</a> that I&rsquo;ll let you read about on their website.</p>

<h3>Ecommerce Slack Chat</h3>

<p>The first slack community I started is a place for <a href="http://www.ecommerceslackchat.com">all things Ecommerce</a>.  If you want advice on any aspect of Ecommerce or want to contribute to the community, please <a href="http://www.ecommerceslackchat.com">apply to join</a>.</p>

<h3>Talkshopify.com</h3>

<p>The second slack community I started has a more narrow focus, Shopify.  This group is for shop owners, theme developers or app developers.  Any and all are welcome to <a href="http://www.talkshopify.com">apply</a>.</p>
