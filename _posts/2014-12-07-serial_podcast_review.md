If you love *who done it* movies, then you'll really love the [Serial Podcast](http://www.serialpodcast.org) from the people behind [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org).  Just barely into episode one I was hooked.  I wanted to listen to as many episodes as I could.  Currently I'm working on episode six.  

A brief description from the Serial website:

> On January 13, 1999, a girl named Hae Min Lee, a senior at Woodlawn High School in Baltimore County, Maryland, disappeared. A month later, her body turned up in a city park. She'd been strangled. Her 17-year-old ex-boyfriend, Adnan Syed, was arrested for the crime, and within a year, he was convicted and sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison. The case against him was largely based on the story of one witness, Adnan’s friend Jay, who testified that he helped Adnan bury Hae's body. But Adnan has always maintained he had nothing to do with Hae’s death. Some people believe he’s telling the truth. Many others don’t.

It's very similar to a television program.  New episodes come out weekly that reveal a bit more of the story.  It's the first time I've been excited for new episodes of something other than my favorite TV shows.

Here is episode one:
